### Execution log — Phase 1 (2026-07-03)
- **Pre-flight ✅** — BMCs `.20/.21/.22` reachable; Tailscale lifelines up; Ares wired `enp0s31f6 .100` restored (was `linkdown` — see topology note).
- **⚠️ Topology correction:** `CLAUDE.md` states Ares WiFi is WAN-side (`192.168.1.x`); observed 2026-07-03 it is on **VLAN 1** (`wlp2s0 192.168.10.199`) and the wired leg had been down. Wired leg now up (BMC/switch traffic prefers `enp0s31f6`), WiFi is backup. **TODO:** correct `CLAUDE.md` + [[Networking/Network Overview]].
- **BMC MACs (for switch-port mapping):** QuarkyLab iDRAC `.20` = `b0:83:fe:e4:9a:60` · Jarvis iDRAC `.21` = `18:66:da:97:0f:8e` · Randy IPMI `.22` = `0c:c4:7a:67:cc:01`. (EX3400 MAC-table lookup pending switch login — key auth denied.)
- **Switch ports (from EX3400 MAC table):** QuarkyLab iDRAC `.20` → **ge-0/0/30** · Jarvis iDRAC `.21` → **ge-0/0/44** · Randy IPMI `.22` → **ge-0/0/32** · Ares → **ge-0/0/41**. Each BMC port had exactly 1 learned MAC (direct access). ⚠️ old buildout doc's "ge-0/0/32 = UniFi uplink" is **stale** — live UniFi trunk is ge-0/0/46.
- **1.1 Switch trunk ✅ committed (2026-07-03):** ge-0/0/30·32·41·44 → `interface-mode trunk`, `native-vlan-id 1`, `vlan members [default trusted]`. Applied via `commit confirmed 10`, verified BMCs still ping on `.10.x` (native VLAN 1 intact) + switch/Ares links up, then plain `commit`. `show vlans trusted` = 30/32/41/44/46.
- **1.2 Ares VLAN 20 leg ✅ (2026-07-03, live/non-persistent):** created `enp0s31f6.20` = `192.168.20.199/24` (VLAN 20 tagged). Switch learns Ares MAC on `trusted` (ge-0/0/41). Direct VLAN 20 **L2 confirmed** — ARP resolves `.20.1` → OPNsense `bc:24:11:12:30:00` over `enp0s31f6.20`. ICMP to `.20.1` is dropped by OPNsense's VLAN 20 interface firewall (no allow rule yet — Phase 3); irrelevant to same-subnet Ares↔BMC. ⚠️ one transient wired-carrier drop mid-session (cable reseated → stable). **Not yet persisted** to `/etc/network/interfaces` (deliberate — persist after BMCs verified).
- **Fallback for BMC re-IP:** if a BMC becomes unreachable on VLAN 20, recover via **Tailscale → node → Redfish** (iDRACs) / `ipmitool` (Randy). Do BMCs **one at a time**, QuarkyLab iDRAC as pilot.
- **1.3 QuarkyLab iDRAC ✅ (pilot, 2026-07-03):** re-IP'd `.10.20 → 192.168.20.20` (VLAN 20 tagged, gw `.20.1`) via iDRAC web UI; root password rotated same visit → Vaultwarden. Verified from Ares: `.20.20` direct via `enp0s31f6.20` (3/3), `.10.20` gone, HTTPS 302, switch learns iDRAC MAC on `trusted` (ge-0/0/30). Stale `default`-VLAN MAC entry aging out (no VLAN 1 IP).
- **1.3 Jarvis iDRAC ✅ (2026-07-03):** re-IP'd `.10.21 → 192.168.20.21` + root pw rotated (web UI). Verified from Ares: `.20.21` direct (3/3), `.10.21` gone, HTTPS 302, MAC on `trusted` (ge-0/0/44).
- **1.3 Randy IPMI ✅ (2026-07-03):** scripted in-band via `ipmitool` on the Randy host (channel 1): set ipaddr/netmask/defgw, then `vlan id 20`. **Gotcha:** enabling the VLAN zeroed the IP (`0.0.0.0`) — re-applied ipaddr/netmask (no lockout, in-band). ADMIN pw rotated (web UI, user id 2). Verified from Ares: `.20.22` direct (4/4), `.10.22` gone, HTTPS 200, MAC on `trusted` (ge-0/0/32).
- **1.4 Drop native VLAN 1 ✅ (2026-07-03):** ge-0/0/30·32·44 → `vlan members trusted` only, `native-vlan-id` removed (stale `default` MACs had already aged out — BMCs send tagged-20 exclusively). `commit confirmed 5`, verified all 3 BMCs still up on `.20.x` + gone from `.10.x`, then `commit`. Ares ge-0/0/41 left dual (native 1 + tagged 20).
- **Ares `.20` leg persisted ✅:** `enp0s31f6.20` = `192.168.20.199/24` (no gateway) added to `/etc/network/interfaces` (backup `interfaces.bak-vlan20-*`); `ifquery` validates; live iface not reloaded.
- **Docs synced ✅:** CLAUDE.md + [[Networking/Network Overview]] BMC IPs → `.20.x`; Ares WiFi-on-VLAN1 correction recorded.
- **1.5 OPNsense firewall ✅ verified (2026-07-03):** operator added **Block** rules on **LAN** and **Servers (VLAN 30)** interfaces (`<iface> net → 192.168.20.0/24`, above the allow-any), plus a **Pass** `192.168.10.199 (Ares) → 192.168.20.0/24` for WiFi-path resilience. BMC egress was already default-denied by the VLAN 20 interface (no pass rules). Verified: Ares→BMC **pass** (ping + HTTPS 302/302/200 over L2 `enp0s31f6.20`), pve3 (VLAN 1) **blocked**, Randy (VLAN 30) **blocked**. Key insight: Ares↔BMC is same-subnet **L2 and bypasses OPNsense**, so no allow was strictly required for the wired path — the Pass rule only matters when Ares falls back to WiFi.
- **⚠️ OUTSTANDING HARDWARE ISSUE:** Ares wired leg `enp0s31f6` (switch `ge-0/0/41`) **flapped 3× during this session** — carrier drops to 0; admin `ip link set up` does not restore it when the cable is physically out. It is **both** the documented mgmt lifeline **and** the VLAN 20 jump-host L2 path. **Action: replace the patch cable / try another switch port.** When it's down, Ares silently reroutes VLAN 20 traffic via WiFi→OPNsense (correctly blocked by the firewall), so BMC access is lost until the Pass-Ares rule or the cable is in play. — **PHASE 1 COMPLETE (all sub-steps ✅).**

## 0. Objective & threat model

Today **VLAN 1 is flat**: hypervisor management + corosync, out-of-band BMCs (with default creds `root/calvin` and `ADMIN`), internet-exposed web apps (Vaultwarden, Homepage, Grafana, NPM), and the admin workstation all share one broadcast domain. A single compromised web service sits at L2 next to the Proxmox `:8006` API and the iDRACs.

**Target state — three trust tiers, built in three phases:**

| Phase | Goal | Tier produced |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Move BMCs off the flat LAN + rotate default creds | **VLAN 20** — out-of-band, reachable from Ares only, no egress |
| **2** | Move internet-exposed service containers off the mgmt plane | **VLAN 30** — server workloads (reuses the existing servers segment) |
| **3** | Firewall VLAN 1 down to a pure management plane | **VLAN 1** — hypervisor mgmt + corosync only, reachable from VLAN 20 only |

**Out of scope (deliberately):** moving corosync; moving pve host mgmt IPs off VLAN 1; moving Pi-hole (`.10.177`) — it stays as directly-connected DNS for all tiers via a firewall allow.

# Phase 1 — Out-of-band lockdown (BMCs → VLAN 20) + credential rotation

**Why first:** highest security ROI. Full hardware/console control of all three servers is currently one flat hop away behind vendor-default passwords. BMCs are standalone (their own dedicated NICs) and belong to **no cluster** — moving them cannot touch corosync or quorum, so this phase is low-blast-radius despite being high-value.

### 1.0 Pre-flight (read-only gate)
```bash
# Confirm each BMC responds on VLAN 1 today
for i in 20 21 22; do ping -c1 -W1 192.168.10.$i && echo "  .$i UP"; done
# Discover each BMC's DEDICATED switch port by its MAC (run per BMC MAC)
ssh mason@192.168.10.50 'show ethernet-switching table | match <bmc-mac>'
# Secondary lifeline into each host (survives BMC re-IP): Tailscale on the node
for n in quarkylab randy jarvis; do ssh $n 'tailscale ip -4 | head -1'; done
```
**Gate:** all 3 BMCs ping, their switch ports identified, Tailscale up on all 3 hosts (so a locked-out BMC is still recoverable host-side). Confirm you have console/crash-cart access to at least one node.

### 1.1 Switch — trunk VLAN 20 to each BMC port (additive, `commit confirmed`)
First define VLAN 20 if it is access-facing only on the trunk today, then trunk each dedicated BMC port. Per the template, use the dead-man switch:
```
configure
set vlans trusted vlan-id 20                       # if not already present
set interfaces <bmc-port> unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
set interfaces <bmc-port> unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members default
set interfaces <bmc-port> unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members trusted
set interfaces <bmc-port> native-vlan-id 1
show | compare
commit confirmed 5
```
**Verify within 5 min** from Ares: `ping 192.168.10.<i>` for each BMC still works (still answering untagged on native VLAN 1). **Good →** `commit`. **Bad →** auto-rollback in 5 min.

### 1.2 BMC — add VLAN 20 tagged IP (add-before-remove)
On each iDRAC/IPMI **web UI** (simplest; racadm is not installed and Ares curl can't negotiate the iDRAC's legacy TLS — see [[Compute/Dell R730 - ML Node]]). If you must script it, use **Redfish curl FROM the node** as documented.

- iDRAC → **iDRAC Settings → Network**: set **VLAN Enable = On, VLAN ID = 20**, static `192.168.20.<i>/24`, gateway `192.168.20.1`.
- The BMC will drop off `192.168.10.<i>` and reappear on `192.168.20.<i>` (tagged). This brief loss is harmless — no workload rides a BMC.

**Verify from Ares once Ares can reach VLAN 20** (Ares gets a VLAN 20 leg in Phase 3, or temporarily trunk VLAN 20 to Ares' port now):
```bash
for i in 20 21 22; do ping -c1 -W1 192.168.20.$i && echo "  .$i on VLAN 20 UP"; done
```

### 1.3 Rotate BMC credentials (do NOT skip — segmentation ≠ auth)
While in each BMC UI: replace `root/calvin` (iDRACs) and `ADMIN` (Randy IPMI) with strong unique passwords. **Store in Vaultwarden**, never in this (public) repo. Reference only, per C7 of the VLAN 30 report.

### 1.4 Remove VLAN 1 footprint (optional hardening, after VLAN 20 verified)
Once every BMC is confirmed on VLAN 20 and reachable from Ares, drop native VLAN 1 from the BMC ports so the BMCs have **no** VLAN 1 presence:
```
set interfaces <bmc-port> unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members trusted
delete interfaces <bmc-port> unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members default
# convert to access if desired:  set ... interface-mode access
commit confirmed 5   # verify VLAN 20 reachability, then commit
```

### 1.5 Firewall (OPNsense) — see Phase 3 matrix
Add now: **allow Ares → VLAN 20** (BMC mgmt ports 443/623/5900), **deny all other → VLAN 20**, **deny VLAN 20 → any** (no egress — BMCs never need the internet).

> ⚠️ **Update docs after Phase 1:** the VLAN 30 report lists iDRAC/IPMI on `.10.20/.21/.22` as a *lifeline*. After this phase that lifeline is on VLAN 20; update `CLAUDE.md`, [[Networking/Network Overview]], and the node compute docs. Tailscale remains the re-IP-proof lifeline.

# Phase 2 — Service LXCs → VLAN 30 (reuse the servers segment)

> ### 🔄 EXECUTION PLAN — revised & reconciled 2026-07-08 (read this first)
> A live survey reconciled the 5-day-old plan below. Key deltas + decisions:
> - **pve3 is behind the UniFi switch** (its MAC is on EX3400 `ge-0/0/46`, the UniFi trunk). So VLAN 30 → pve3 is a **UniFi access-port** change (native VLAN 1 + tagged VLAN 30), **not** an EX3400 change. VLAN 30 already transits `ge-0/0/46`. **Operator applies it in UniFi; verify before any container moves.**
> - **`vmbr0` is VLAN-aware** on pve3 → per-container `pct set --net0 ...,tag=30` works (no sub-interface needed).
> - The four movers are **DHCP-reserved** (OPNsense, by MAC) → convert to **static** on VLAN 30 to avoid a VLAN 30 DHCP dependency.
> - **NPM: dual-home, do NOT re-IP** (decision 2026-07-08). Add a VLAN 30 vNIC (`.30.181`), keep the VLAN 1 leg (`.181`) for WAN ingress + `:81` admin. No OPNsense WAN-forward or admin-allowlist changes; NPM reaches moved backends on VLAN 30 and still reaches Wazuh/llm on VLAN 1.
> - **Open WebUI CT 107 (`.185`) INCLUDED** (new service since original plan) → `.30.185`.
>
> **NPM coupling map** (CT 101 Docker `jc21/nginx-proxy-manager`; `set $server` in `/opt/nginx-proxy-manager/data/nginx/proxy_host/*.conf`):
> | Public name | Upstream now | Backend | Action |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | vault.kylemason.org | `.10.182` | Vaultwarden CT102 | → `.30.182` |
> | grafana.kylemason.org | `.10.183` | Grafana CT103 | → `.30.183` (+ VLAN30→VLAN1 `:9100` allow for Prom scrape) |
> | homepage.kylemason.org | `.10.148` | Homepage CT106 | → `.30.148` |
> | chat.netframe.local | `.10.185` | Open WebUI CT107 | → `.30.185` |
> | llm.netframe.local | `.10.31` | llm_router (Jarvis) | stay (optional repoint → `.30.31`) |
> | wazuh.kylemason.org | `.10.184` | Wazuh (QuarkyLab VM104) | stay VLAN 1 |
>
> **Sequence — one at a time; `vzdump` snapshot + verify + git checkpoint between each:**
> 0. **Operator (UniFi):** trunk VLAN 30 → pve3 port (native 1 + tagged 30). **Verify:** temp `vmbr0.30` on pve3 (`192.168.30.250/24`) pings `.30.1`, then remove it.
> 1. **Dual-home NPM** — add `net1` `tag=30` `.30.181` to CT 101; verify WAN ingress + `:81` admin still work.
> 2. **Pilot: Vaultwarden CT102** → `.30.182`; repoint NPM `$server`; verify `vault.kylemason.org` end-to-end.
> 3. **Homepage CT106** → `.30.148`; then **Grafana CT103** → `.30.183` (add `:9100` allow); then **Open WebUI CT107** → `.30.185`.
> - **Stay on VLAN 1:** Headscale CT105, Wazuh VM104, Pi-hole (DNS reachable cross-VLAN by firewall allow).

**Why:** isolate internet-exposed apps from the hypervisor management plane. This reuses the **exact dual-home mechanics** of the VLAN 30 migration — but here we tag a *container's* vNIC, not the host's. **The pve3 host mgmt IP stays on VLAN 1.**

### 2.0 Per-service disposition (decide before moving)

| Service | LXC/VM | Now | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NPM (ingress) | 101 / pve3 | `.10.181` | **Move → `.30.181`** | Sole WAN ingress; belongs in the workload/DMZ tier |
| Vaultwarden | 102 / pve3 | `.10.182` | **Move → `.30.182`** | Internet-exposed web app |
| Grafana/Prom/Loki | 103 / pve3 | `.10.183` | **Move → `.30.183`** | Exposed UI; needs a firewall hole to scrape VLAN 1 `:9100` (see below) |
| Homepage | 106 / pve3 | `.10.148` | **Move → `.30.148`** | Internet-exposed dashboard |
| Wazuh | VM 104 / QuarkyLab | `.10.184` | **Keep on VLAN 1** | Agents on VLAN 1 nodes → manager; moving forces cross-VLAN agent traffic. Revisit later. |
| Headscale | 105 / pve3 | `.10.186` | **Keep on VLAN 1** | VPN control plane; re-IP disrupts all tailnet clients. Leave unless you re-key deliberately. |
| Pi-hole | pve1 LXC | `.10.177` | **Keep on VLAN 1** | Shared DNS for all tiers via firewall allow (per template Step 5) |

> The two exposed collectors (Grafana/Prometheus) do move, but they must still reach `node_exporter` on VLAN 1 hosts — that requires a **VLAN 30 → VLAN 1 `:9100`** allow (see Phase 3). This is an accepted, narrow hole; everything else VLAN 30 → VLAN 1 stays denied.

### 2.1 Per-container migration (repeat for NPM, Vaultwarden, Grafana, Homepage — **one at a time, verify between**)

Reserve the new IP, snapshot/back up the container to PBS first, then re-tag its vNIC to VLAN 30 and re-address inside:
```bash
# On pve3 — back up, then re-point the container NIC to VLAN 30 (vmbr0.30 tagged)
vzdump <CTID> --storage <pbs> --mode snapshot          # fresh restore point
pct set <CTID> --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,tag=30,ip=192.168.30.<x>/24,gw=192.168.30.1
pct reboot <CTID>
```
> If `vmbr0` is **not** vlan-aware, use the `vmbr0.30` sub-interface pattern from the VLAN 30 report (C5). If you ever enable `vlan_filtering` on `vmbr0`, add VID 30 to the bridge/port PVID/vids — documented caveat.

**Verify (per container):**
```bash
pct exec <CTID> -- ip -br a                              # on 192.168.30.<x>
pct exec <CTID> -- sh -c 'ping -c2 192.168.30.1; getent hosts github.com'   # gw + DNS
```

### 2.2 Fix the couplings (add-before-remove; sweep for hardcoded `.10` IPs)
This is where the VLAN 30 report's C8 (hidden IP couplings) bites hardest. For **each** moved service, update every reference, then verify end-to-end:

- **NPM upstreams:** every proxy host pointing at `.10.182 / .10.183 / .10.148` → repoint to `.30.x`. If NPM itself moved to `.30.181`, update the WAN port-forward / firewall target on OPNsense.
- **DNS records** (Pi-hole local + any public A/CNAME behind Cloudflare/NPM) → new `.30.x`.
- **Homepage widgets** (`/opt/homepage/config`) referencing service IPs → `.30.x`.
- **Grafana datasources / Prometheus targets** → keep scraping VLAN 1 `:9100` (allowed hole); Grafana's own URL changes to `.30.183`.
- **NPM `:81` admin allowlist** (currently locked to Ares `.199`, DOCKER-USER F-05) → update to Ares' reachable IP.
```bash
ssh pve3 'grep -rIn "192.168.10.\(181\|182\|183\|148\)" /opt 2>/dev/null'   # sweep
```
Prove each service through its real front door (browser via NPM) before moving the next.

### 2.3 Rollback (per container)
`pct set <CTID> --net0 ...tag=<none>,ip=192.168.10.<orig>/24,gw=192.168.10.1` + `pct reboot`; revert NPM/DNS/Homepage refs; restore from the pre-move `vzdump` if needed.

# Phase 3 — VLAN 1 management-plane hardening (OPNsense firewall)

**Why last:** only after BMCs (Phase 1) and exposed services (Phase 2) have left VLAN 1 can you safely clamp it. This also completes the "Phase 3 (operator, OPNsense GUI)" item explicitly deferred at the end of the VLAN 30 report.

### 3.1 Give Ares a VLAN 20 (trusted) presence
Ares is the jump host — the only thing allowed into the management plane and the BMCs. Add a VLAN 20 leg (tagged sub-interface on `enp0s31f6`, or trunk its EX3400 port native 1 + tagged 20). Keep the wired VLAN 1 leg during cutover so you can't lock yourself out (WiFi is WAN-side `192.168.1.x`).

### 3.2 Inter-VLAN firewall matrix (target)

| Source → Dest | Allow | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **VLAN 20 (Ares/OOB)** → VLAN 1 mgmt | ✅ | SSH `:22`, PVE `:8006`, PBS `:8007`, EX3400, iDRAC mgmt |
| **VLAN 20** → BMCs (VLAN 20) | ✅ | Ares only; 443/623/5900 |
| any → **VLAN 20** | ❌ | except Ares |
| **VLAN 20 (BMCs)** → any | ❌ | no BMC egress |
| any (except VLAN 20) → **VLAN 1 mgmt** | ❌ | management plane is closed |
| **VLAN 30 services** → VLAN 1 `:9100` | ✅ (narrow) | Grafana/Prometheus scrape only |
| **all tiers** → Pi-hole `.10.177:53` | ✅ | shared DNS (per template Step 5) |
| **VLAN 30** → internet (egress) | ✅ | via `.30.1` (already live) |
| **VLAN 1 mgmt** → internet | ⛔ / limited | allow only OS/PVE update endpoints if desired |
| Guest 60 / IoT 40 → any internal | ❌ | isolated (UniFi-side; verify) |

### 3.3 Verify the clamp (from a non-trusted host, expect failures)
```bash
# From a VLAN 30 service box — mgmt plane should be UNREACHABLE:
ssh vaultwarden 'curl -m3 -sk https://192.168.10.201:8006 && echo REACHABLE(bad) || echo blocked(good)'
# From Ares VLAN 20 — mgmt plane SHOULD work:
curl -m3 -sk https://192.168.10.201:8006 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"     # expect 200/401
# DNS still resolves from every tier:
ssh vaultwarden 'getent hosts github.com'
```

## Global safeguards (carried from the VLAN 30 migration)
- **Corosync untouched** on VLAN 1 — the cluster is never at risk in any phase.
- **`commit confirmed 5`** on every EX3400 change (dead-man auto-rollback).
- **Additive-first / add-before-remove** at every step — fully reversible.
- **Two lifelines per host:** BMC (Phase-appropriate VLAN) **and** Tailscale (survives any re-IP).
- **One device/container at a time**, verifying before the next; VM-hosting node last.
- **Back up before you touch:** `vzdump` each LXC; `interfaces.bak-*` on any node edit; export switch config.
- **No secrets in this public repo** — EX3400/iDRAC/Grafana creds live in **Vaultwarden** (report C7).
- **Keep Ares wired on VLAN 1** through the whole change (WiFi is WAN-side; OPNsense is the inter-VLAN SPOF — report C3).

## Rollback (whole change, any phase)
1. **Phase 3:** disable the new VLAN 1 deny rules → back to permissive inter-VLAN.
2. **Phase 2:** revert each container to `.10.x` (untagged) + restore NPM/DNS refs (or `vzdump` restore).
3. **Phase 1:** BMC network config back to VLAN 1 `.10.<i>` untagged; switch `rollback 1; commit`. (Credential rotation is kept — it's pure upside.)
4. **Cluster:** nothing to undo — untouched throughout.
5. **Lockout recovery:** node console / crash-cart, or `ssh <tailscale-ip>` into the host, then fix the BMC/bridge from inside.

## Do / Don't
- ✅ Rotate the BMC default creds **regardless** of how far you take the VLAN work — that's the single biggest fix.
- ✅ Keep Pi-hole, Headscale, and corosync where they are; open narrow firewall holes instead of moving infra.
- ✅ Verify from a *non-trusted* host that the mgmt plane is actually unreachable — an untested firewall is a false sense of security.
- ❌ Don't move corosync or any pve host mgmt IP. ❌ Don't clamp VLAN 1 (Phase 3) before BMCs+services have left it. ❌ Don't drive a switch/BMC cutover over the exact path you're re-IP'ing without a second lifeline. ❌ Don't commit secrets to this public vault.
